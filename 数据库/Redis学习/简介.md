# Redis简介

官方原文

```
Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string; incrementing the value in a hash; pushing an element to a list; computing set intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest ranking in a sorted set.

In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log. Persistence can be optionally disabled, if you just need a feature-rich, networked, in-memory cache.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave asynchronous replication, with very fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection with partial resynchronization on net split.

Other features include:

Transactions
Pub/Sub
Lua scripting
Keys with a limited time-to-live
LRU eviction of keys
Automatic failover
You can use Redis from most programming languages out there.

Redis is written in ANSI C and works in most POSIX systems like Linux, *BSD, OS X without external dependencies. Linux and OS X are the two operating systems where Redis is developed and tested the most, and we recommend using Linux for deploying. Redis may work in Solaris-derived systems like SmartOS, but the support is best effort. There is no official support for Windows builds.

Redis（Remote Dictionary Service）是一个NoSql数据库，基于c开发，键值对存储数据，单线程结构, 分布式锁,运行在缓存内存中，高速缓存数据

特点：

- 支持数据持久化
- 支持多种不同的数据结构
- 支持从模式的数据备份
- 自带发布订阅系统
- 定时器，计数器

应用场景

- 记录帖子的点赞数 评论数 和点击数(hash)
- 记录用户的帖子ID列表(排序) 便于快速显示用户帖子列表(zset)
